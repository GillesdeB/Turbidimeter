# Turbidimeter
For Science Hack Day 2019 in San Francisco, we propose a water filtration system to turn dirty water into a drinkable, clean, sanitary fluid, using local supplies and an optional electronic turbidity measurement.

## Creators
Chloe Bonneau, Gilles de Bordeaux, Virginie de Bordeaux

## APIs, data and tools used
Reclaimed plastic bottle, paper or cloth, sand, gravel, charcoal.
Arduino (I had an ESP8266 and used it, but you should find the most basic and cheap Arduino available).
1 x red LED and 1 x green LED.
5 volts power bank (a solar cell and a condenser should be sufficient, as the power consumption is very limited)
1 x photocell
