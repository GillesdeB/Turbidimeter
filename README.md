# Turbidimeter
For Science Hack Day 2019 in San Francisco, we propose a water filtration system to turn dirty water into a drinkable, clean, sanitary fluid, using local supplies and an optional electronic turbidity measurement.

## Creators
Chloe Bonneau, Gilles de Bordeaux, Virginie de Bordeaux

## APIs, data and tools used
- Reclaimed plastic bottle, paper or cloth, sand, gravel, charcoal.
- Arduino (I had an ESP8266 and used it, but you should find the most basic and cheap Arduino available).
- 1 x red LED
- 1 x green LED.
- 5 volts power bank (a solar cell and a condenser should be sufficient, as the power consumption is very limited)
- 1 x photocell

## Possible improvements
- Enclose the electronic and the solar cell into a ring that can fit many bottle sizes
- Manage the total cost to be less than $0.90
- Design an undestructible To-It-Yourself instructions sheet to create and use the water filter
- Ask for production and distribution help from an NGO like the Billa And Melinda Gates Foundation, the Red Cross, etc.
- Distribute wherever unsanitary drinkable water supply is an issue
